# Portfolio Mockup to HTML

This project is part of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001), we received a design mockup as a PDF-file and must create a personalized responsive portfolio that can be displayed on a Desktop, Mobile (Google Nexus 5) or a Tablet (Apple iPad) and no content should be hidden on mobile devices. [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) was used as a grid system and HTML5 semantic tags have been used to better describe the content.
